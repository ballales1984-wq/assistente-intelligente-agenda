====== POST ======
Hey r/productivity! 👋

I just launched a free web app that helps organize your life using AI and natural language.

🎯 **What it does:**
- Chat in natural language (IT/EN/ES): "Study Python 3h/week" → automatically schedules it
- Smart calendar with intelligent conflict management (splits/reduces overlapping events)
- Goal tracking with progress analytics  
- Expense tracking with graphs
- Personal diary with sentiment analysis
- 📖 **UNIQUE FEATURE:** Swipeable diary like a real book on mobile (touch gestures!)

✨ **Features:**
- 100% Free forever
- No login required (starts immediately)
- PWA (installable as native app)
- Dark mode ready
- Multi-language (IT/EN/ES)
- Export to PDF, iCal, CSV
- PostgreSQL database (permanent data)

🔗 **Try it:** https://assistente-intelligente-agenda.onrender.com

Built in Flask + PostgreSQL, deployed on Render. Open source (Apache 2.0).

The diary feature is my favorite - you can literally swipe through your journal entries like a real book. Never seen this before! 📖

Would love your feedback! What features would you add? 🚀
